# Online Accounting - Ongoing Project
Welcome to the repository of my online accounting project, developed in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/readme) with a streamlined installation and management approach using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).

This initiative aims to consolidate my knowledge acquired in my studies by creating a sales page for accounting services and incorporating a modern look with a dark template.

## Technologies and Tools

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/readme): Used to structure the project and follow the MVC pattern.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/): Facilitating the efficient creation of development environments.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/): Relational database for storing crucial information.

## Revised Contents
### During the development process, I solidified previously studied knowledge, such as:

- MVC Structure: Implementation and understanding of the Model-View-Controller architecture for organized development.
- Controllers and Views: Utilization of controllers to manage requests and update corresponding views.
- Models: Creation of models to represent and interact with database data.
- Requests and HTTP Verbs: Effective handling of HTTP requests, incorporating different verbs for specific operations.
- Laravel Faker, Seeders, and Factories: Generation of test data, population of the database with seeders, and efficient use of factories to create fictional records.
- Laravel Relationships: Implementation of 1-to-1, 1-to-N, and N-to-N relationship concepts in models as needed.
- MySQL Database: Review of concepts related to the creation and manipulation of tables in MySQL, efficiently integrating the database with Laravel.
